# Hashing Theory üîç

## Introduction üåü
Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and cryptography, used to efficiently locate a data record given its search key. Hash functions map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. These fixed-size values are typically used as indices in hash tables, where the data is stored.

## Hash Functions üîë
A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.

### Properties of a Good Hash Function ‚úÖ
1. **Deterministic**: The same input always results in the same output.
2. **Efficiently Computable**: The function should be able to return the hash value quickly.
3. **Uniform Distribution**: The hash values should be uniformly distributed to avoid clustering.
4. **Minimize Collisions**: A good hash function minimizes the chances of two different inputs having the same hash value.

### How Hash Functions Work üõ†Ô∏è
Hash functions work by taking an input (or 'message') and returning a fixed-length string of bytes. The process involves:

1. **Input Data**: The original data that needs to be hashed.
2. **Hash Algorithm**: The set of operations used to transform the input data into the hash value.
3. **Output Hash**: The resulting fixed-length hash value.

For example, a simple hash function could sum the ASCII values of characters in a string and take the modulus with a prime number.



### Example Calculation üìè
To demonstrate how a hash value is calculated, consider the string "hello":

1. **ASCII Values**: Convert each character to its ASCII value.
   - 'h' = 104
   - 'e' = 101
   - 'l' = 108
   - 'l' = 108
   - 'o' = 111

2. **Sum of ASCII Values**: 104 + 101 + 108 + 108 + 111 = 532

3. **Modulus Operation**: 532 % 10 (assuming a hash table size of 10) = 2

The hash value for "hello" would be 2.

## Applications of Hashing üåç
1. **Hash Tables**: Used for implementing associative arrays, databases, and caches.
2. **Cryptography**: Ensuring data integrity and security.
3. **Data Retrieval**: Quick data lookup and retrieval.

## Hash Tables üóÇÔ∏è
A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. Hash tables use hash functions to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

### Example of a Hash Table üìö
Consider a hash table storing student records by their ID:

## Collision Resolution üöß
Since hash functions can map different keys to the same hash value (a collision), a good hash table should include a collision resolution mechanism.

### Methods of Collision Resolution üîÑ
1. **Chaining**: Each bucket is a linked list. When a collision occurs, the new entry is added to the list.
   ![Chaining Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Hash_table_5_0_1_1_1_1_1_LL.svg)

2. **Open Addressing**: All elements are stored in the hash table itself. When a collision occurs, a probing sequence is used to find the next empty slot.
   - **Linear Probing**: Sequentially checks the next slot until an empty one is found.
   - **Quadratic Probing**: Checks slots at increasing intervals.
   - **Double Hashing**: Uses a second hash function to determine the probe sequence.

## Cryptographic Hash Functions üîí
Cryptographic hash functions are used in security applications. They have additional properties such as:
1. **Pre-image Resistance**: It should be difficult to reverse the hash function.
2. **Small Changes in Input**: A small change in input should produce a significantly different hash.
3. **Collision Resistance**: It should be difficult to find two different inputs that hash to the same output.

### Example of a Cryptographic Hash Function üîê
The SHA-256 hash function is widely used in security protocols. It generates a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value, typically rendered as a 64-digit hexadecimal number. SHA-256 is part of the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions, designed by the National Security Agency (NSA).

#### Properties of SHA-256
1. **Fixed Size Output**: The output is always 256 bits, regardless of the input size.
2. **Deterministic**: The same input will always produce the same output.
3. **Pre-image Resistance**: It is computationally infeasible to reverse the hash function to obtain the original input from its hash value.
4. **Collision Resistance**: It is highly unlikely to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.
5. **Avalanche Effect**: A small change in the input (even a single bit) produces a significantly different hash.

#### How SHA-256 Works
1. **Pre-processing**: The input message is padded to ensure its length is a multiple of 512 bits.
2. **Initialize Hash Values**: The initial hash values (H0-H7) are derived from the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first eight prime numbers.
3. **Message Schedule**: The padded message is divided into 512-bit chunks, and each chunk is processed to generate a schedule of 64 words.
4. **Compression**: The schedule words are processed in a series of 64 rounds, using bitwise operations, modular additions, and constants derived from the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers.
5. **Final Hash Value**: The output of the final round is added to the initial hash values to produce the final hash value.

#### Visualization of SHA-256 Process

#### Practical Applications of SHA-256
- **Digital Signatures**: Used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages and documents.
- **Blockchain**: Fundamental to the security and operation of blockchain technologies like Bitcoin.
- **Certificate Authorities**: Ensures the integrity and authenticity of digital certificates.
- **Password Hashing**: Used to securely store password hashes.

In the context of a student attendance system, SHA-256 can be used to hash student IDs or other sensitive information, ensuring the security and integrity of the data.

## Example: Hashing a Simple Message
Let's see an example of hashing the message "hello world" using SHA-256:

1. **Input**: "hello world"
2. **SHA-256 Hash**: `b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfa0c7f4a7e8b713a05fadb0d7b6e6e0a5e`

As shown, the hash value is a 64-digit hexadecimal number representing the 256-bit hash.

SHA-256 provides a secure way to ensure the integrity and authenticity of data, making it a critical component in modern security protocols.
